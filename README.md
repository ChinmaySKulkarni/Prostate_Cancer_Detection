## Possibly try the following:

1. **PCA, ICA, NMF:** Apply PCA, ICA, NMF on patches of data. Remove most prominent eigen vector (presumably common to both classes)
2. **Edge Detection:**
	1. Edge detection can be used to reduce the feature space by filtering out information that might be less relevant + intensifying structural differences like texture, variation in illumination, etc. --> [Edge Detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection)
