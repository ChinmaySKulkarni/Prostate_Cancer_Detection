Changelog
- Image sizes are not uniform - Added padding on the image borders to make the
image sizes uniform.
- Did PCA on the two datasets -3 and 4, PCA reports the data to be low
  dimensional - 23 and 12 dimensions respectively, but classifier performs
  poorly on projected as well as raw data. Somehow reduce the data to a lower
  dimension without sacrificing class separation.
